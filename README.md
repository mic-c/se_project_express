# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The **WTWR** back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. This project involves working with databases, setting up security, testing, and deploying web applications on a remote machine. The goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Features

- RESTful API for managing user data and clothing items.
- MongoDB integration for data storage.
- User authentication and authorization.
- Error handling and validation.
- Middleware for request parsing and user mocking.
- Hot reload support for development.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/wtwr-backend.git
   cd wtwr-backend
   ```

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing
